# Longest consecutive Sequence

1. Build a function
2. The function will get an unordered array of numbers called nums
3. The function will return the longest length of a consecutive array that can be built using the values in nums
4. The function MUST have a time complexity of O(n) or better

[100,4,200,1,3,2] - 4
[0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] - 9
